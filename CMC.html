<h1> Claremont Mckenna's Dining Hall: Collin's </h1>
<img width=500px height=50px alt='Collins Dining Hall' src="https://images.app.goo.gl/nKqFghbomSPsqw466">
<p>
	Collin's Dining Hall is located in the center of the campus, wedged between the campus's northern dorms and mid quad. </p>
<p> 
	Collin's Hours of Operation:
	M-F: 7:30-9:30, 11:00-1:00, 5:00-7:00
	Weekends: 10:30-12:30, 4:30-6:30 </p>
<p>
	In terms of dining options across the schools, Collin's falls somewhere in the average range. The hall is known for their 'performance bowl', a stir-fry-esque dish which is frequently served as an option during lunch time. Collin's has a solid variety of drinks and a cold brew dispenser that sets it apart from the rest. The staff is extremely friendly and takes the time to offer each student a nice day. The environment is clean, with a fairly plain and generic atmoshere in comparison to some of the other halls. Another unique option provided by this hall is the late night snack, served 10:30-12:30, giving students an opportunity to satify late-night cravings with muchies such a soft pretzels and churros. Overall, Collin's is a pretty consistent option, but diners should weary of certain entrees that may fall below par. </p>
