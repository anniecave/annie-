	In terms of dining options across the schools, Collin's falls somewhere in the average range. The hall is known for their 'performance bowl', a stir-fry-esque dish which is frequently served as an option during lunch time. Collin's has a solid variety of drinks and a cold brew dispenser that sets it apart from the rest. The staff is extremely friendly and takes the time to offer each student a nice day. The environment is clean, with a fairly plain and generic atmoshere in comparison to some of the other halls. Another unique option provided by this hall is the late night snack, served 10:30-12:30, giving students an opportunity to satify late-night cravings with muchies such a soft pretzels and churros. Overall, Collin's is a pretty consistent option, but diners should weary of certain entrees that may fall below par. </p>
