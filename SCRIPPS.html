<h1> Scripp's Dining Hall: Mallot </h1>

<p>
	Mallot Dining Hall is located a stone's throw from CMC's campus, looking out on to Bowling Green. </p>

<p> 
	Mallot's Hours of Operation:
	M-F: 7:30-10:00, 11:15-1:30, 4:45-7:00
	Weekends: 10:45-1:00, 5:00-6:30 </p>
<p>
Mallot may be more limited in terms of their options, but many of the entrees that they do make, they make well. Students come to Mallot when they know that a specific option is being served, such as sushi lunch on fridays and taco dinner on mondays. Due to the popularity of certain meals, the lines accumulate fast, so on popular days it is a good idea to arrive early. The food at Mallot is extremely fresh and the hand-tossed salads are perfect for someone who is looking to eat clean. The indoor seating is a bit cramped, but outside patio provides a beautiful view of bowling green and the enclosed court yard provides a tranquil place to enjoy a meal. </p>
