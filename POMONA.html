<h1>Pomona's Dining Halls:<span style="color:black"> Frary, Frank, Oldenborg</span></h1>
<h2> Frary </h2>
<img width=500px height=50px alt='Frary Dining Hall' src="https://images.app.goo.gl/41ijJGzpeq2kmPHt6">
<p> Frary is located on the opposite side of Amherst Ave. from CMC, under the bell tower that dominates the campus's skyline. </p>
<div>
<p>
	Frary's Hours of Operation: </p>
</div>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li> M-F: 7:30-10:00, 11:00-2:00, 5:00-8:00 </li>
	<li> Weekends: 8:00-1:30, 5:00-8:00 </li>
	</ul>
	 </p>
<p> Frary is reknowned for its long, wooden benches, high ceilings, and unique mural, making students feel as though they go to school at Hogwarts instead of one of the 5Cs. Frary is also known for its weekend brunch, especially the avacodos that are included in that experience. Students can head to the omlette line to recieve an avacado to make their own avacado toast or bagel, which generates a surprising amount of excitement. Frary also stays open for dinner later than the other dining halls, serving as a good last resort for someone who lost track of time. The dining hall does a good job accomodating vegan and vegetarian students, serving options for those with special dietary restrictions at every meal. </p>

<h2> Frank </h2>
<img width=500px height=50px alt='Frank Dining Hall' src="https://images.app.goo.gl/qXWPVe8VYHSgDbS19">
<p> Frank is located on Pomona's South Campus, across the street from the Byron Dick Seaver Theatre complex and near the Studio Art Museum </p>
<div>
<p>
	Frank's Hours of Operation: </p>
</div>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li> M-Th: 7:30-10:00, 11:30-1:00, 5:00-7:00</li>
	<li> Fri-Sat: Closed</li>
	<li> Sun: 11:00-1:00, 5:30-7:00</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p> Frank is one of the smaller dining halls with a very differen vibe form that of Frary. With both booths and round tables, the atmosphere is more restaurant and less teaditional dining hall. Another unique aspect of this dining hall is a private room that can be reserved for meetings. The most note-worthy food offerring from Frank is the pizza bar, serving pizzas with a wide variety of toppings that are better quality than most of the other pizza served at 5C dining halls. </p>

<h2> Oldenborg </h2>
<img width=500px height=50px alt='Oldenborg Dining Hall' src="https://images.app.goo.gl/vzGo8YVyGeYFJpZdA">
<p> Oldenborg Dining Hall is located inside the Oldenborg Center for Modern Languages and International Relations. </p>
<div>
<p> 
	Oldenborg's Hours of Operation: </p> 
</div>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li> M-F: 12:00-1:00 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Oldenborg is by far the smallest dining hall of the 5C's that is strictly open for a one hour lunch on weekdays. The main draw of Oldenborg is its diverse cultural atmosphere. The hall has many foreign language tables and presents lectures on various international topics. Many different cultural cuisines are served to compliment this environment of diversity, offering a meal predominantly from one country per day, with additional favorites such as pizza and salad. Oldenborg is probably not a great place for a loud and boisterous group of friends, but perfect for a spanish study group. </p>
